		<h1>Authentication using Neural Network Analysis of Pattern Tracing</h1>
		<p>
		To log in, you must first train the system to recognize how you trace a shape.  You will train the system six times in a row.  Each training will consist of tracing the black square shown below.  You may re-trace the shape as many times as you would like to for each training.
		</p>
		<p>
		When you are happy with your tracing for the current training, click the "Next" button below the shape.  After the sixth training is complete you will have successfully trained the system.
		<br>
		If you are using a device with a touchscreen, please trace the shape using the touchscreen.  Tracing with the mouse will work, but will not provide as good of data.
		</p>
		<p>
		After you have finished training, you will be asked to log in to the system by tracing the shape once more.
