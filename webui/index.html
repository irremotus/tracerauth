		<h1>Authentication using Neural Network Analysis of Pattern Tracing</h1>
		<h2>Welcome to our Usable Security user study!</h2>
		<p>As part of this study, you will complete the following steps:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Teach the website how you draw</li>
			<li>"Log in" to this website using pattern tracing</li>
			<li>Fill out a short questionnaire</li>
		</ol>
		
		<p>This will take approximatly 10 min to complete.<br>To begin, click <a href="train.html">here</a> to start the training.</p>

			What are we trying to do?<br>
			<tab>We want to create a way to login to a website, phone, or computer by simply looking at how you trace a shape. 
				In order to do this we need data from lots of people. This is where you come in!
			<br>
			What data are we collecting?<br>
			<tab>We will be collecting where and when your pointer is while tracing the shape, as well as some basic demographic information in the questionnaire.
